seholars stood round him (p. 422), for what is forbidden.
aa to such a privilege, in the erese of a bacheler would te
still less likely to be granted to a sophist. We see the
elasa then standing round the master, who was in fen
academieal eostume; this consisted of a blaek cape, boote
(p. 478), hood‚ whether a gown was worn at lectum
does not appear, but in walking in publio it was neees-
sary (p. 301) and probably therefore at lectures. The
lectum consiste entirely of oral instruction, hence the
scholaris always said “oad‘ire leotioaea,'' “rosporrdaa
“ qoaeato'oot',” “ auditioni tostus tralataa‚’' &a (p. elo,
242) and after hearing long enough, along with sueh
other practice aa he could obtain, he was obliged to repeat
what he had learnt (p. 243). It was required that the·

seholar should spend four years in the studies prelimi·
nnry to the haehelor's degree (p. 410), and this period
was divided into two parts, during the first portion the

scholar was called “ sophista generalis,'’ and he might not
present himself for “ responsione ’' besor the expiration of
one year at the least (p. 242). All the statutes preserved
to us are very difficult to understand, and often contradie
tory to each other: among other things which it seems
impossible to determine with certainty, we do not find it
stated distinotly what were the suhjeots of examinatior
at responsione as distinet from those at determination
(p. alr-3), we know indeed that four years were neees-
sarily to be spontin the study of logio, rhetoric, grammar
and aritlnnetie,'and perhaps musio, (though it is not clear
as to tho latter, whether it belonged wholly to the studies
after determination (t. o. the baehelor's degree) or whether
a portion of the time spent in the study was taken
during the four years of the sophist’s training (p. 286) ),
hut we ean only form the very natural conjecture that
themora elementary parts of these formed the subjecta
ofoxmnination at responsione. Nor again do we find
any regulations as to the appointment of the masters
