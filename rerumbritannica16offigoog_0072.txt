We would gladly linger a little on the picture fancy here
presente to us, but it would be mere fancy, to so great an
extent have all means of actually reproducing mediaeval
life perished. Το mention one thing only which strikes Theaommeaee-
us, and shows how utterly all details of life are lost, we Μ mm
can hardly conceive what must have been the effect of
the arrival of so large a number of men and horses in the
town as must have occurred atthis time every year, how
the latter were returned, or, if not, where and when sold,
and whence provided again, are perhaps trivial inquiries,
but they open to the thought scenes of interest and
means of employment which might otherwise pass un-
observed, and which, moreover, may assist us perhaps in
forming a juster conception of the life we attempt to
pourtray. The amount of buying and selling, for in· Bury aare of

from it, may, among other things, contribute towards
accounting for the great frequency and activity of law-creauere οἵ
suits of which there is evidence in the documenta ¹¹²¹⁸³⁸¹⁰¹¹'
before ua, and for which so very large a machinery
existed, it would appear, at Oxford; but of this more
will be said hereafter.

We do not propose to watch the distribution of our
party of scholare· among the several balls to which
they went, we will follow one, however, as well as we
can; he is one of the youngest‚ and his case therefore
will be somewhat different from those os the elder. He
was to wmutance his educaticn at Oxford. And to
understand this matter aright, we must not any longer
delay adding somewhat to cur previous account of the
schools. The short notice given above (p. 46) of those
institutione, was meant to apply to the schools of the
several higher faculties only, and of them it was by no
means intended to be a complete account ; besides them, meschone

there existed many other schools, for instance, every ffizffim'
