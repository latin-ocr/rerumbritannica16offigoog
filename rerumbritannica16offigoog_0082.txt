seems ιο point once more to the conclusion already
stated that the masters lived by keeping boarding
schools, and were psid m adifferent way from, and ιιι
a more remunerativo way than the teaehers of the other
faculties, ιο which we must now proceed.

No maximum limit (p 286) seems to have been prs- Dmuon οι

grammatical training above sketched, nor is there any unnng
reason to suppose that there practically existed any
limit, beyond that which convenience would 1mpose,
either ιο the age at which boys commenced, or¹ at which
they relinquished the work of elementary educati0n3 as a
matter of convenience and custom they would be generally
of the age we have presumed‚ and we may suppose that
from two ιο four years would be the ordinary duration
of their schooling, while οιι the other hand, some would
enter considerably later and therefore finish also later.

very much3 we may set' ιι tdown as from the twelfth to⁰¹¹¹¹n
the fifteenth or sixteenth year3 and again there were
very considerable numbers of students who graduated
without ever passing regularly through the academieal
course, and who were allowed to count “pro sorvuc”
exercises and studies undergone elsewhere ; numerous
instances of which will be found in the extracta from
the register of Convocation (A a) in this work.

But having premised thus much, by way of opinion commence
