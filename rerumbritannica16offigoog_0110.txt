But, supposing a boy to go to Oxford at tho age of school
eleven years, we have to reokon, say, two years of school· expensa.
ing, as to the expensas of whioh we have no definite date,
but it mnnot be put at a less sum than the above for ’
eaeh year; we have therefore two years at the school,
and four years before the Baohelor’s degree, and three
before the Master’s degree ; this will bring our scholar to
the age of twenty years at his Master of Arts degree,
and his expensas during that time will have amounted
to sal. 19s. Το this must be added, as we heresem,
certainly as much aa seven pounds for various necessary,
or praetioally necessary, payments for feasts, perquisitas
of bedels, and fees on graduation and the like ; for books
and clothes we may allow him ten shillings a year
more. This will bring his whole expensas from the· age Toal mount.

bo seen that no reokoning has been made for journeys,
nor for expensas during vacation, for reasons to be given
presently3 we will meanwhile pause to observe that in
eomparing the above expensos with those of more
medem times, we are met by the serious question of the
relative velue of money at different periods in our
history: there is no space here for a disquisition on this
subject, but one or two observatione may assist us in
our comparison. The allowanoes for the scholare, or
follows, of University and Merton Halls was about fifty
shillings a year, besides an addition for rooms and
servants of about half as much more every year. From Comparative

aoomparison of the value of corn at that time with the ffievfissffiel

average of the present day we may estimato that money at the presentt

isnow3 and in the fifteenth century, at which our reokon-

ing is supposed to be made, money is known to have been

much more valuable than in the thirteenth: it is pro-
bable, therefore, that we may consider that it was twenty
times as valuable in the fifteenth century as it is now
and this calculation seems to be borne out by the prioes of
