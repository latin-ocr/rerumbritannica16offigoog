to run the gauntlet of determining without further

inquiry, and his successful or non-successful performance

brought with it the consequent applause or disgrace,

which seems to have been the only gustantes that he

should really exert himself. Some of the provisions of

the statutus on this subject are unintelligible, at least

tothe editor, for instance, those which provide for the Dearminaeon
division of the determinem into two companies (p. 240) forachem.
and again the distinction between those who determine

“pro se'' and “ pro aliie.'' Can it be the ease that more

proficient scholare were allowed to disputo sor others,

and wealthier for those that were poorer? It would

seem so,-—at least that wealthier masters incepted for

poorer is plain (p. 731). If this was the case, and ¹
practised to any extent, (and the editor believes this

to have been s0,) then the division of the determiners

into two portions becomes less difficult to understand3

for the number of actual disputants would thus not be

so very numerous: and thus they might in turn gonuraipnqr

proposed by each master in his turn (p. 453), and yct

be ableto complete the whole course within nine days3

a minimum limit, which, however, might be exceedcd,

and doubtless often was so by the more proficient candi-

dates, who would continue to go from school to school

exhibiting their logical powers perhaps for weeks,
concluding always, however, by the end of term (pp. 240,

244). Nine days of disputation,f1·om 9 o’clock till 12 am,

and again from 1 o’clock till 5 p.m.‚ must have been

indeed a serious test. Itis almost needlcss, perhaps, 1011111001
