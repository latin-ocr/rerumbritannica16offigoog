the ether extrnvnganoea which have been repeated
nn the purpose of enhaucing the reputation of the
University, must be reckoned the statement oi Rich-
anl of Armagh, that there were iu the thirteenth
century, 30‚000 scholare at Oxford. lt is apparent
fram the known boundariee of the city at the time,
that this is next to impossible, and, certainly, quite
incredible. Explanations have been attempted, ιο the
effect that under “ scholare '' is here intended to be
reckoned the whole number of persons who could claim
the privilege of the University (see pp. 52, 346). And
thet this number included all clerks also of wlmtever
ape living at exford, and that there were no public or
other grammar schools except here and at Cambridge,
in Englnnd, so tbat all the youth of the kingdom were
educated at these two places. But no sort oi ground
for mting the numbers at so great an amount really
exists3 un thu aintrary, it is probable that, of scholare

give a far more true approximation to the reality; to these
may, perhaps, be added nearly as many more members
of the privilege, but nol· studente. At any rate, in the
evidences we possess, we find no more than about eighty
balls3 from tho remains of such as now exist, and there
are several, we cannot put their inhabitants at more
than an average of thirty, and this is, it is likely, a
very high average to allow. This, the outside number
ol studente which we can allow even in the most
ssourishiug period of the history of the University,
would suppose the existence of at least double the
nunrber oi halls Ιετιοιιηι ιο have been in use ,at any
