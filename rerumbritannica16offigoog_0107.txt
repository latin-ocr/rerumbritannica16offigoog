we know, obliged by statute to enforee the payment
of his salary from his scholare (p. 427); this payment took
place at the end of term, and was called “collectiore''
(pp, 129, 236), a name which, now applied in a wholly
different sense, has often puzzled the curicus as to
its original meaning. This “ collection,'’ then, levied by
each master lecturing, varied according to the subject
taught ; for lectures in grammar the statutable payment
was eightpence for each term, for logie threepenoe, for
natural philosophy fourpence (p. 427); reckoning four
terms (which was the usual mode) to the year. These
arc the only subjecte for lectures in which we find re-
gular payments speeified in the documenta before us;
with regard to the higher faculties, we find from one
instance, canon law (p 401), the payment for lectures in
them was at a very mueh higher ratic, but, in aecor-
dance with our plan, the detailed inquiry into these
must be omitted. As to the other subjecta, in which
the ordinary student in Aris would require lectures,
i. c. arithmetic‚ rhetoric, geometry, astronomy, ee, we
have no statement as to the fees to be demanded, but
in all subjects during the same term no oue could
require assistance3 we may reasonably estimate the
expenses therefore of the studentior lectures at about
two shillings the term, taking one year with another,
and supposing lectures in the last-named subjects to
be charged for at the same price as those in natural
philosophy. There remain several other items to be
rechoned3 the payment of the bedols, ior whom the

University was eareful to provide (p. 250), and the
payment of the servants of the halla: the amount due
'to these was regulated by the expenses of the scholar
andawauain himself ; each had to pay two servants, a alpeliar and

an trasarice (a euricus instance, again, of the vitality of
