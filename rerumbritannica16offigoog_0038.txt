aud sord, beeause the analogy of the name Oseueye
would point ιο the origin of the name from ose or

ouer and ford.

This theory' rs not without merite, but it seems most memo ¹085
likely aster all that the old derivation rs the right one, οἰ ‘¹¹‘ ”⁸¹¹¹

aud that it rs more likely that osea-eye, is itselfa
corruption of eoeneye, when we compare with it the
name of the neighbouring villages of Hengseye (now
Hiuelrsey), (see page 516). Thus Oxen-eye and Hengs·
eye would be the islored of the oe aud the horae
respectively, and Oxeuford is probably one of the same
family of names. With the history, however, of the
