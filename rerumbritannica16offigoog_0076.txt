at the 11110 of which we are treating now, the
exemption in favour of lay-houses cen only have
existed in the case of the grammar scholare ; for in
the year 1421 the king, elarmed at the frequent
violatione of the peace 11 Oxford, issued an ordinanoe
(p. 277) which required all scholare and servants of
years of diaeretica to be under some sufficient principal;
and further, the University, in the year 1432, ordered
that every such prinoipal should be 1 graduate (p. 307) ;

This was an evil not eradicated, however, by royal or
acidemical legislation; for, several years luter, (pp. 563,
576) we find the same class of scholare “ nnattached’‘
banished from the University for homicide. It seems
indeed that the plan of living in lay-houses‚ in the case ‘
of elder studente, was so grave an evil during all the
early history of the University, that it was the subject
01 constant anxiety and statute-making, and doubtless
vas 010 of the chief reasons which finally led to the

complete success 01 the collegiste system. Ι
