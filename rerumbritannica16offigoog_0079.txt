‘¹ sophiae,'' printed by the well known J. Barda, of
Daventry (Anno 1490), in which will be found such
a scene as we are supposing exhibited, disfigured ol
course by the usual absence ot' perspective and the
grotesque angularity cf figure common to mediaevol art,
but nevertheless sufficiently like the reality to reproduce
the main features of the scene; the scholare there de·
picted are plainly very yonng; and from the mouth, or
round the head of the centra] figure (the editor speaks
from menrory) runs a scroll “ accipies tanti doctoris
“dogmata sancti.'’ The figure teaching dcuhtless is
intended for Boethius himself, but, as muel, it must be
supposed that the whole conceptiones the print and
details, so far as it has any, are derived not, of course,
from his time but from those of the printer of the work.

We proceed to the matter treated ofin the lecture, and

· here wc need be in no uncertainty either as to the suh·

ject‚ the text books, or the mode of instruction. For the
purpose of arranging the system of instruction to be pirr-
sued during the ensuiug term the grammar-school masters
used to hold a meeting called “ eonvenite '' at the begin-
ning of term, and also at the end, and at other times when
necessary, that they might act together in concert3 a
wholesome regulation which we do not find to have
existed in the case cf other faculties (p. 437). Every
such master before being licensed to teach underwent an
examination in versification‚ dictetion &a (p. 436), lest,
as the statute has it, the words of Isaiah should prove
true “ ocultiplicesti perricio, noo oucbtt letitiam ;’'
further, they were held to he responsible for the moral

on. and religious training cf their pupils (ibid), “cum

“ oporteat singulos pro eibi ocmorbeo grege coram
‘¹ tremendo Judc'ce rationem reddere iu die tecua-
“tionis et miserice;” a provision which goes far to
prove the correctness of what hasbeen above advanced,
that the boys resided in the houses of their masters.
