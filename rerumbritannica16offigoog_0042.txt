order to obtain the privilege of having the sovereign·
of the country as visitor of their society. The evidence

against Alfred having ever founded any exhibitione at

all at Oxford is of course of a purely negative cha

racter3 but it is very strong, for none of those authors, .

in whose writings we should certainly have expected ’

to find mention of such a circumstance, make any

allusion to it whatsoever. To begin with Assar. Hensearmakesno
at any rate, the instructor and friend of Alfred the¹¹¹²⁰⁶⁰¹¹⁰fi¹⁸
collector of his memorable actions, when ascribing to

him the building of two monasterias, the maintenance

of teachers for his own children and those of his nobles

would surely, one would think, never have omitted to

record a work of sc kindred a nature as the establish-

ing of educational exhibitione or places of learning at

Oxford. And yet we find in this author no such
statement, for although it was indeed affirmed¹ that
one of the MSS. of Asser contained such a passage, yet,

it ie believed, no such thing is now to be found, and
the said passage was, moreover, affirmed by those who
saw it to be a manifest interpolation. But even though ’
it were granted that Alfred did, as alleged in the
spurious passage of Asser, establish places of edueation

at Oxford, yet there would be nothing to indicate that

he had any hand in the founding of University Hall.

The same absence of any mention of such connexion Early chron-

between this king and the University is equally re-{fcrgpl'i{¹fflent

markable in all the earliest authors, in Ethelward‚ inormeeublect·
the Angla-Sason Chronicle, in the chronicle of Mail·

ros, in Ingulphus, in Marianus Scotus, in Florence of
Worcester, William of Malmesbury, Henry of Hun-

tingdon‚ Roget Hoveden‚ Matthew of Westminster,

and others, all of whom, while they extol the wisdonr,

valour, and piety of Alfred, are altogether silent as to

his supposed endowments at Oxford!
