various members and recommending them to bishops
and other magnates. This register was transcribed from
the original letters, presumed to be destroyed when
the register was made, by Farley, the scribe of the
University at the time. It hae only been used in the
present work for the purpose of publishing the (lata
logues of Duke Humfrey's books, which will accordingly
be found in Part II. of this volume. The editor has,
however, read and catalogued almost the whole, with
a view to an extensior of the work now edited, at a
future period. The letters are principally in Latin,
