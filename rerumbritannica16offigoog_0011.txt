The works to be published in octavo, separately, as
they were finished3 the whole responsibih’ty of the task
testing upon the editors, who were to be chosen hythe
Master 01 the Rolls with the sanction 01 the Treasury.

The Lords 01 Her Majesty’s Treasury, astera eareful
consideration of the subject, expressed their opinion in a
Treasury Minute, dated February 9, 1857, that the plan
recommended hythe Master 01 the Rolls “was well
calculated for the accomplishment 01 this important
national object, inan effectual and satisfactory manner,
within a reasonable time, and provided proper attention
be paid to economy, in making the detailed arrange·
ments, without unnecessary expense.”

They· cxprcssed their approbation 01 the proposal that
each chronicle and historical document should be edited
in such a manner as to represent with all possible eor·
rectness the text 01 each writer, derived from a collation
01 the best MSS, and that no notes should be added,
except such as were illustrative 01 the various readings.
'l'hey suggested, however, that the preface to each work
should contain, in addition to the particulare proposed
by the Master 01 the Rohs, a biographical account 01
the author, so far as authentia materials existed for that

purpose, and an estimato 01 his historical credibilitp⁷ and
value.
