(called at first the N ew schools) would never have been
considered an improvement, and if 00 theu the 1100000
10 which the schools were must have been small It
seems most likely that each house or school 0001010οἀ
more thau one, perhaps several chambers used for this
purpose, 00 lecture-roomo in fact, by the master who
occupied them Every master at his ·‘ inception’' (1.0.
00 commeucing the exorciso 01 1110 newly-acqui1ed right
of lecturing) was obliged to be provided with 0 school
100 that purpose (p. 415). Now, 00 inception with the
course 01 lectores succeeding it occupied the remainder
01 the current year and the whole 01 that succeediug, the
number 01 inceptors lecturiug at one time must have
been greatly above thirty-two in all the faculties together.

was in fact several schools ; and each several school wae
occupied by its own master with his audienoe 01 scholare.

the “ grammar schools ;’' 11 is¹ possible that some of
the thirty-two schools above mentioned may have been
used at times 100 this purpose, but it would appear that
the grammar schools were distinct (p. 363) and 01 an in-
ferior aud subordinate character, liable 10 inspection by
two Masters 01 Arte deputed 10011101 purpose (p. 85), and -
not unfrequently taught by other than groduates (p. 87),
who were, however, always obliged to be licensed for
that purpose (p. 136). More may he said 01 these when
speaking 01 the studies 01 the University ; we will now
glauce at thc condition and earliest known establishment
