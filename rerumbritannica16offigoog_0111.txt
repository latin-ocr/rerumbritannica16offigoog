various articles mentioned in the documenta here printed
which will occur to the reader. Thus we should find
that, in money of the present day, a youth’s whole educa-
tion could be paid for from the age of eleven to twenty
years—after which time, having incepted, it is to be pre·
sumed he could support himself either by lectures at Ox-
ford or otherwise elsewhere in life-for the sum of 639l.
Asta journeys aad vacatiori expensas, the two being
closely connected, we should observe that no scholare
left Oxford at all, or in rare cases, between October
9th and J rdy 7th at the least ; a very large number
did not leave the University at all even during the
long vacation, as is evident from several allusions in
this volume, and especially from one case, already cited,
that, namely, of the schoolmaster John Martyn and his
scholars (p. 601). These who did leave probably often
walked home, and even begged their way about the
country, being, as we find from other sources, quite a '
nuisance sometimes to the formem and others at whose
doors they sought alms. Aa would be expected, how-
ever, there arc scarcely any hints even as to the manner
in which the vacations were spent roucy from Oaford
in these documenta. Now and then we find studies during
the vacation recognized, but these apparently were pur-
sued at Oaford (p 88): once indeed we find (p. 684) two
poor scholars receive authority from the University to
beg alms3 but beyond what has already been mentioned
little else will bc found to account for the occupatiori of
scholars during the vacation. ·In all probability, however,
those who left the University during that time certainly
did not increase their expenses, and many would add to
their resources: there are, however, other works in
which more will be found than can be given here on this
nemoralib- subject. Before dismissing this subject it should be
{gfffiffim stated that the foregoing calculation of a scholar's ex-

penses is supposed to represent the outlay of one in fairly

comfortable circumstances at the period we speuk of: ”
