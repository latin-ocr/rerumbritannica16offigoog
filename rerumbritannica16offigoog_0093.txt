The examination at responsione having been duly
passed, the scholar has now taken his first step towards
graduation, and, supposing him to have responded
during his second year, there will remain two full years
or more, according to the time at which he entered, to
be spent in the studies necessary before determination
or the degree of Bachelor of Arte. The books to be used
for this examination haue already been specified and, as
we there stated, it is probable that grammar and arith·
metio formed the chief, if not the only subjecte of

more particularity than responsione, so that we shall
be able to follow our scholar with morecertainty through
this part of his academical course. We will suppose, then,

At 9 o’clock, the great bell of St. Mary'e Ohurch
begins to sound, (p. 280) all the 32 schools in School
Street are occupied by their several masters sitting in
full academical dress, and with their desks before them
awaiting the arrival of the scholars; for it has been
ordered (p. 245) that the exercises must take place in
