submittod to the neamy a proposui for the publication
01 materiale for the History 01 this Oountry from the
Invasion 01 the Romans to the Reign 01 Henry VIII.

The Master 01 the Rolls suggested that these materiale
should be selected for publication under competent
editors without reference to periodical or chronological ,
arrangement, without mutilation or abridgment, prefer·
enee being given, in the first instance, 10 such materiale
as were most source and valuable.

ment te be edited should be treated in the samo way as
11 the editor were engaged on an Editio Princeps ; and
for this purpose the most correct text should be formed
from an accurate collation 01 the best MSS.

To render the work more generally usefrd, the Master
01 the Rolls suggested that tho editor should give an
account 01 1110 MSS. employed by him, 01 their age and
their peculiarities3 that he should add to the work a
brief account 01 the 1110 and times 01 1110 author, and any
remaiks necessary to explain the chronology3 but no
other note or commentans 10 be allowed, except what
might be necessary 10 establish the correctness of the

text.
