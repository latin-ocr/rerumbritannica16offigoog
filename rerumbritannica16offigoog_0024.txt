notes as to assize of measures, dae, and price of wheat3
and, lastly, by a collection of comparatively modern
statutes-of the years 1564-5, according to Bryan
Twyne's opinion-which have been added to the volume,
and bound up with it on the occasion of its last
binding, as it would seem. The “ inapecimas” by
Queen Elizabeth, which stands at the commeneement
of the MS, as stated above, was evidently there placed
at the same time. ‚The original binding of the volume
was, itis known, far more costly than the present,
and ornamented with a silver clasp. The book was
solemnly delivered to each succeeding Chaneellor on
his election, along with the other insignia (see p. 284),
and by him similarly surrendered at the expiration of
his term of office.

Next in order is the MS. marked B, known as the The southern
Senior or Southern Proctor’s book This is a largerP¹⁰⁰l⁰l⁸b⁰⁰h
volume than A, but contains almost exaetly the same
matter, with, however, some additions and some ornis-
sions. Almost the exact date of this MS. is known 3 for
the expenses of the productiori of the volume are to
be found in the Archives of the University, where the

following particulars, under the year 1477, occur.
