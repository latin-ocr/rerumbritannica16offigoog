be added the loss of the whole leisure of one year (or
nearly) from severe illness, and lastly the removal to the
charge of an onerous'and laborious parish at a distance
from all books of reference during the past year3 which
last circumstance will, it is hoped, be accepted as au
excuse for some slight errore which may appear to the
reader. In two particulare the stereotyped custom will
be found to have not been followed; first as to “errata’'
or “ corrigenda.” One of these has already been apolo-
gized for, and there are two others which the editor would
correct here; one is that, by inadvertence, lbarsday
is put instead of Friclay, on margin of p. 86; the other
is that ‘⁶ hots,'' on the margin of p. 3, should bs “ caps.”
Iu the second place no vocabulary hae been given ; and
for this reason: whatever words occur in this work which
the editor did not himself understand while preparing the
work, he was able to find either by having recourse to Du
Gange or to other well known glossaries, and very often
those of DiherAllras, declamarem, dre.; and those sources
of knowledge are, it is presumed, equally acccesible to
others; some few words, however, he regrets to say, are
to be found in this volume which he could not find any·
where, nor meet with any explanationes them; it seemed

not very useful therefore to arrange them, to the amount
of half-adonem on a sheet by themselves.

Lastly, there remain the “protelarem actioaas.'' First
the aeknowledgments of the editor are due, where they
cannot be received. If the present work supplies any gap,
the idea of first undertaking it was suggested hythe late
Canon Shirley and so far the credit is due to him ; at
least he first suggested to the editor the idea that there
were documents worth publishing in the Archives at Ox·
ford ; whether he was right or no the reader must form
his own opinion: for the work itself the editor is alone

responsible ; but he cannot but acknowledge with affec·
tionate remembrance the assistance so often rendered by
Dr. Shirley during the course of a friendship of many
