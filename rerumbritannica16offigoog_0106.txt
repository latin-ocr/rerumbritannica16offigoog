A few observatione have been promised on the Expresso of an
expensas 01 an University course at the time we ffifflhe
speak of 3 we will now glauce, somewhat hastily offlsteenth
necessity, atthis subject. In the first place we may century.
affirm without hesitation that no fee whatever was
required to be paid on entrance or matriculation;
so far as hindrance from this cause is concerned the
scholar was unfettered; he came 10 Oxford and en·
tered any hall he had reason to prefer. In the halls
the expenses would doubtless va‘ry according to the
style of the members3 but 10 take au average case, and
such, we may suppose, arethe cases which we shall
appeal to 101 our fauts, the expensas of an ordinary
scholar may be thus reokoned in the fifteenth century.

11101, bis “ commons '' or “ batels ’' would seem to have Batels,
eost him from eightpence to one shilling a week, seldom

more (p. 469). Next, for the rent 01 his “coetera” ermom-rent
room, supposing him to have a separate apartment, it
appears that he would pay 10 116 Principal of his “
hall about two shillings and sixpence a term; thie
sum, at any rate, was the actual charge in the case of
“Athelstane Hall,” in the year 1446 (p. 555), and we

may infer that it was about the usual amount, for in
airother instance we find aclerk (in this case a priest‚

and therefore 01 mature age and probably decently
lodged) paying four shillings for room and lecturos

(p. 664), and we are further confirmed in our estimate

by finding (p. 655) that Master Richard Browne‚ Arch-
deacon 01 Rochester, a considerable pluralist, and, as
appears from his will, a wealthy man, perid, for his room

' in Lineoln Oollege, thirteen shillings and fourpence 101
ayeer's rent3 a sum, which, allowing for the pre-
sumably superior accommodatior he would require, will
correspond fairly with the previously named charges.
